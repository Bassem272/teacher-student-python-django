For a teacher-student-parent platform, you'll likely need endpoints to handle various functionalities such as authentication, user management, data retrieval, and data manipulation. Here are some suggested endpoints you might consider implementing:

### Authentication Endpoints:

   - `POST /auth/reset_password/`: Reset the user's password using a token.

### User Management Endpoints:
1. **User Profile**:
   - `GET /user/profile/`: Get the profile of the currently authenticated user.
   - `PUT /user/profile/`: Update the profile of the currently authenticated user.

3. **User Deactivation**:
   - `DELETE /user/{user_id}/`: Deactivate or delete a user account.
