In Django, you can achieve this by using middleware and view functions (controllers). Here's a general outline of how you can implement this:

1. **Middleware to Check Data Validity**: Create a middleware class in Django that intercepts incoming requests and checks the validity of the data. In your case, this middleware would inspect requests to retrieve teacher details and verify if the provided teacher ID is valid.

2. **View Function (Controller)**: Define a view function (controller) that retrieves the details of the teacher based on the valid ID. This view function will be responsible for processing the request and fetching the necessary data from the database.

Here's a basic example of how you can structure your middleware and view function:

```python
# middleware.py

class TeacherIDValidationMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Check if the request is to retrieve teacher details
        if request.path == '/api/teacher-details/':
            # Check if the teacher ID is provided in the request body
            teacher_id = request.POST.get('teacher_id')
            if not teacher_id:
                # Return a response indicating missing ID
                return HttpResponse("Teacher ID is required", status=400)
            else:
                # Validate the teacher ID (perform your validation logic here)
                if not is_valid_teacher_id(teacher_id):
                    return HttpResponse("Invalid Teacher ID", status=400)
        return self.get_response(request)

# views.py

from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import Teacher

def get_teacher_details(request):
    # Retrieve the teacher ID from the request body
    teacher_id = request.POST.get('teacher_id')

    # Fetch the teacher details from the database based on the ID
    teacher = Teacher.objects.get(id=teacher_id)

    # Prepare the response data
    response_data = {
        'name': teacher.name,
        'subject': teacher.subject,
        # Add more fields as needed
    }

    # Return the teacher details as JSON response
    return JsonResponse(response_data)
```

In this example, `TeacherIDValidationMiddleware` intercepts requests to `/api/teacher-details/`, checks if the request contains a valid teacher ID, and validates it. If the ID is missing or invalid, it returns an appropriate HTTP response. Otherwise, the request proceeds to the view function `get_teacher_details`, which retrieves the details of the teacher from the database based on the valid ID and returns the details as a JSON response.

Make sure to include the middleware in your Django settings (`MIDDLEWARE`) and map the view function to a URL pattern in your `urls.py`.
